The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP), which belongs to
NP-hard problems and is considered a typical problem for many real-world applications . In TSP, given a set of
cities where each city is visited exactly once by the
salesman and returns to the initial city with a
minimum distance tour . When the number of
cities is increased, the convergence rate to solve
TSP is normally decreased . TSP is normally
considered a good problem to evaluate the
performance of newly established algorithms. TSP
is very useful for real-world applications . Since the exact
methods are not efficient for solving the largescaled TSP due to the huge computational time
consumed, the researchers in the optimization
domain tend to apply the approximation approaches
to solve TSP .
